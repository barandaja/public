User Story: ESA Certificate Request Submission
As a pet owner
I want to submit my ESA certificate request through the platform
So that I can get connected with a licensed mental health professional for my evaluation

Acceptance Criteria:
Given I am a logged-in pet owner on the platform
When I navigate to "Request ESA Certificate"
Then I should see a multi-step form to submit my request
Given I am filling out the ESA request form
When I complete Step 1 (Personal Information)
Then I must provide:

Full name
Email address
Phone number
State of residence
And all fields should validate in real-time
And I cannot proceed without completing required fields

Given I am on Step 2 (Pet Information)
When I enter my pet details
Then I must provide:

Pet name
Pet type (dog/cat/other)
Pet breed (optional)
Upload pet photo (optional, max 5MB, jpg/png)
And the form should auto-save my progress

Given I am on Step 3 (Health Background)
When I answer screening questions
Then I must provide:

Brief description of why I need an ESA (text area, 100-500 characters)
Confirmation that I understand this requires a consultation with an MHP
And I should see a privacy notice about my information

Given I am on Step 4 (Payment)
When I proceed to checkout
Then I should:

See the total cost clearly displayed
Be able to enter payment via Stripe/WooCommerce
Receive payment confirmation via email
And my request should be automatically assigned to an available MHP

Given I have successfully submitted my request
When the payment is processed
Then I should:

See a confirmation screen with my request ID
Receive an email with next steps and expected timeline
Be redirected to my dashboard showing request status as "Pending MHP Assignment"

✅ System Behavior:

✅ Data Captured:

Notes for Developers:

Use existing authentication system for logged-in users
Integrate with current Stripe/WooCommerce setup
Auto-save functionality should trigger every 30 seconds
MHP assignment logic: round-robin to available MHPs in pet owner's state
File upload: implement size validation and file type restriction
Email templates need to be created for confirmation workflow


Priority: High
Effort Estimate: 2 sprints (assuming 1-week sprints)
Dependencies: Stripe/WooCommerce integration must be complete
